# Introduction to Physical AI and Human-Aided Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum on **Physical AI and Human-Aided Robotics: Bracing the Digital Brain and Physical Protein**. This educational platform provides a structured learning path through four interconnected modules that progressively build your understanding from foundational robotic concepts to advanced AI integration.

## Course Overview

This curriculum is designed to guide you through the essential concepts, technologies, and practical implementations needed to understand and develop physical AI systems. Each module builds upon the previous one, following the principle of "Sim-to-Real First" where concepts are first understood in simulation before application to physical systems.

## Module Structure

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

- Introduction to ROS 2 and middleware architectures
- Robot modeling with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Sensor integration and perception systems
- Basic control systems and motor interfaces

### Module 2: The Digital Twin

- Simulation environments and physics modeling
- Unity integration for visualization
- Model-based design and validation
- Multimodal perception pipelines

### Module 3: The AI Robot Brain

- Cognitive architectures for robotics
- Planning and decision-making systems
- Integration with NVIDIA Isaac and other AI frameworks
- Learning and adaptation mechanisms

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

- Human-robot interaction systems
- Voice-controlled navigation and manipulation
- Autonomous humanoid capabilities
- Cognitive planning and reasoning

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System to establish the foundational knowledge required for the more advanced topics in subsequent modules. Each module includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, technical diagrams, and assessment tools to ensure comprehensive understanding.

This curriculum emphasizes hands-on learning with real-world applications, safety-first implementation practices, and the integration of digital intelligence with physical systems.
