# Course Modules

Welcome to the comprehensive curriculum on **Physical AI and Human-Aided Robotics: Bracing the Digital Brain and Physical Protein**. This educational platform provides a structured learning path through four interconnected modules that progressively build your understanding from foundational robotic concepts to advanced AI integration.

## Module Overview

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System](../module-1-nervous-system/intro)
- Introduction to ROS 2 and middleware architectures
- Robot modeling with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Sensor integration and perception systems
- Basic control systems and motor interfaces

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin](../module-2-digital-twin/intro)
- Simulation environments and physics modeling
- Unity integration for visualization
- Model-based design and validation
- Multimodal perception pipelines

### [Module 3: The AI Robot Brain](../module-3-ai-brain/intro)
- Cognitive architectures for robotics
- Planning and decision-making systems
- Integration with NVIDIA Isaac and other AI frameworks
- Learning and adaptation mechanisms

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](../module-4-vla/index)
- Human-robot interaction systems
- Voice-controlled navigation and manipulation
- Autonomous HUMANOID capabilities
- Cognitive planning and reasoning

## Learning Path

Each module builds upon the previous one, following the principle of "Sim-to-Real First" where concepts are first understood in simulation before application to physical systems. We recommend following the modules in sequence to gain the full benefit of this curriculum.
