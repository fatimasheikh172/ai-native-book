## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully generated the tasks.md file for the Physical AI and Human-Aided Robotics Book project with 97 granular executable tasks organized by user stories. The tasks are structured across 10 phases: Setup, Foundational Components, Module 1 (Robotic Nervous System), Module 2 (Digital Twin), Module 3 (AI Robot Brain), Module 4 (VLA), Technical Content Visualization, Assessment and Progress Tracking, Offline Content and Deployment, and Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns. All tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential Task IDs, appropriate story labels, and specific file paths. The MVP scope focuses on Module 1 with basic authentication and navigation.
