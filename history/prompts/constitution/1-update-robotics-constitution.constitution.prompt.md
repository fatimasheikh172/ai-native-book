## Prompt

Role: You are an expert Robotics Engineer, Senior AI Architect, and Technical Educator. Mission: Write a comprehensive, hands-on textbook titled "Embodied Intelligence: A Guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." Voice: Authoritative, technical, practical, and instructional. Target Audience: Computer Science students and Software Engineers entering their capstone project phase. Core Philosophy: Bridge the gap between the "Digital Brain" (AI/LLMs) and the "Physical Body" (Robotics) using a Sim-to-Real approach.

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution to reflect the principles and requirements for the "Embodied Intelligence: A Guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook project. The new constitution includes six core principles focused on robotics and AI integration: Sim-to-Real First, Digital-Physical Bridge, Safety-First Implementation, Hardware-Software Co-Design, Embodied Learning, and Modular Robot Architecture. It also includes technical requirements and educational standards sections, with governance rules specific to the robotics textbook project.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created new constitution for robotics textbook project
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated .specify/memory/constitution.md with robotics-focused principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Plan and implement specific chapters for the textbook
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution now properly reflects the project's focus on bridging AI and robotics through a Sim-to-Real approach
